Source markdown for my [website](https://amar1729.github.io/).

I use [`simple-markdown`](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown) to convert markdown in `markdown/` to html at the root of this repo, which is what github serves for the site.

In progress: work with python `Jinja2` (templating) and `mistune` (markdown-to-html parser) to replicate the necessary conversion-and-text-manipulation that is currently hacked together in `generate.sh`.

This site is heavily based off of the [blog by christine dodrill](https://christine.website/blog), with code for the site [here](https://github.com/Xe/site) and css [here](https://github.com/Xe/gruvbox-css).
