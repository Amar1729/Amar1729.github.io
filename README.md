Source markdown for my [website](https://amar1729.github.io/).

I use [`simple-markdown`](https://github.com/Khan/simple-markdown) to convert markdown in `markdown/` to html in `docs`, which is what github serves for the site.

This site is heavily based off of the [blog by christine dodrill](https://christine.website/blog), with code for the site [here](https://github.com/Xe/site) and css [here](https://github.com/Xe/gruvbox-css).
